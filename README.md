# Traffic Patterns in Ontario

Being an aspiring data scientist and a university student with no driving privileges to see my girlfriend, I've decided to analyze traffic data from southern Ontario to northern Ontario. More specifically, the route from Milton to Orillia. 

Tools/Technologies Used:
- Python
- SQL (SQLite)
- Tableau
- Google Maps Platform (Directions API)

Project Parameters:
- Alternate routes may be used if it's faster to get from Milton to Orillia
- Travel time is calculated only using the 'driving' mode
- All three traffic models were used to see the contrast between the worst and best-case scenario
- The database stores two months (8 weeks) worth of collected data
    - Frequency: Includes ETAs from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM with 30-minute intervals in between (25 timestamps per day)
