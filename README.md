# TrafficStudy

Being an aspiring data scientist and a university student with no driving privileges to see my girlfriend, I've decided to analyze driving/traffic data from southern Ontario to northern Ontario. More specifically, the route from Milton to Orillia. 

Tools/Technologies Used:
- Python
- SQL
- Tableau
- Google Maps Platform (Directions API)

Data Parameters:
- Alternate routes may be used if it's faster to get from Milton to Orillia
- Travel time is calculated only using the 'driving' mode
- All three traffic models were used to see contrast between worst and best case scenario
- Data collected covers two months (8 weeks) worth of data from 8:00AM to 8:00PM with 30 minute intervals in between
